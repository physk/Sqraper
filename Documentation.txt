IMPORTANT! This is a pre-release. It wasn't intended to be released this soon. It is being released in BETA early and to
limited persons due to lag in picking up new drops from some data sources.

As this point I have only had the opportunity to test it in a Windows 10 command prompt ("PHP.exe Sqraper.php") and have
not had the opportunity to test it on my Linux machine yet. It is never intended to be run as a public facing web page,
especially since that would also expose your "sqraper_config.json" file and thus compromise any FTP credentials and paths
that you may have entered in the config.

In short: 

1) You must have PHP installed. 
2) Run the script "PHP Sqraper.php" from a command line (terminal or command prompt) and the script will create
"sqraper_config.json".
3) Edit "sqraper_config.json" to your liking.
4) Read the comments at the start of the code for further tips.

This script is not for novices. Basic PHP understanding required.

I worked hard to write this in order to help the community. Therefore I ask, if you find bugs and correct them, make
improvements, etc., contribute your changes back to the community via this GitHub. Don't be "that guy". WWG1WGA is not just a
catchy statement, let's all try to live it.

I'll try to get docs done soon and update the Git.
